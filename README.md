# UFO Headpiece

## What it is
A wearable, animated LED UFO headpiece, originally built for the 2025 [McMinnville UFO Fest](https://ufofest.com/)

## How it works
A NeoPixel ring, mounted in a 3D-printed UFO, cycles through custom light patterns running from a Feather RP2040 and powered by a LiPo battery

## Skills needed & difficulty
Overall this is a very beginner-friendly project!
- 3D printing (beginner)
  - I provide the settings that worked for me with the Makerbot Sketch, but you may need to adjust based on printer make and model, level of detail you want, etc.
- Soldering (beginner)
- Coding (beginner/intermediate)
  - Optional; you can copy the provided code.py onto your Feather

## Tools
- For printing the UFO
  - 3D printer
    - Check your local library for free or low-cost printing, introductory classes, and open labs. I printed my UFO for free at the Shute Park Library in Hillsboro, OR
- For testing and assembling the electronics
  - Breadboard or clamps to hold components in place
  - Jumper wires
  - Soldering iron
