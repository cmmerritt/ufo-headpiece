# UFO Headpiece

## What it is
A wearable, animated LED UFO headpiece, originally built for the 2025 [McMinnville UFO Fest](https://ufofest.com/)

## How it works
A NeoPixel ring, mounted in a 3D-printed UFO, cycles through custom light patterns running from a Feather RP2040 and powered by a LiPo battery

## Equipment & materials needed

### ðŸ§° Tools
These are tools you'll need to build or assemble the project. They are **not part of the final headpiece**.

- [ ] 3D printer
  - Check your local library for free or low-cost printing, introductory classes, and open labs. Thanks to Shute Park Library in Hillsboro, OR, where I printed my UFO for free!
- [ ] Soldering iron & solder
- [ ] Breadboard or clamps (for testing)
- [ ] Hot glue gun, tape, and/or superglue (for mounting; I used E6000 and clear packing tape)
- [ ] Screwdriver (for nylon hardware)
 
### ðŸ§© Electronics for UFO
The electronics inside the UFO responsible for light effects. Links to Adafruit parts where available.

- [ ] [NeoPixel Ring - 24 x 5050 RGB LED](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1586)
- [ ] [Lithium Ion Polymer Battery - 3.7v 500mAh](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1578)
- [ ] Jumper wires
  - I tested with male-male jumper wires and also used them for my final product. [Hook-up stranded-core wires](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3111) are probably a better choice for soldering but require stripping with wire strippers

### ðŸ§± Other components for UFO

- [ ] 3D-printed saucer top and bottom 
- [ ] Nylon screw and nut kit (M2 size)
- [ ] Clear plastic cup (for tractor light beam and to hold your UFO securely to the base)

### ðŸŽ¨ Decoration & Finishing

- [ ] Thick felt (one or more shades of green) (for base)
- [ ] Alligator hair clips (for base)
- [ ] Acrylic paint (black, gray, metallic silver...) (for painting UFO)
- [ ] Decorations for base (miniature trees, shrubbery, etc.)
